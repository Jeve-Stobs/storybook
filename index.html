						Think of ATP as a rechargeable batttery, it can be recharged, but only after it is finished expelling all of its energy.
						ATP is very important that supplies energy to the cell. Now why is ATP important? It stores this energy in chemical
						form or juices. This storage is not the same as the kind that powers your refrigerator.
					</p>

						Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries
						you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded
						of men be plunged in his deepest reveriesâ€”stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly
						lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. </p>

            <p>Plants get their energy through Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration. Now those are some large words so let's break 'em down. Photosynthis is where the plant's leaves turn light into energy. It's similar to solar panels and how they work. Except it produces chemical energy, like we spoke about before. You can think of Cellular Respiration like eating when you are hungry. It happens no matter what and you cannot control it. </p>
