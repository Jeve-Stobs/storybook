					<p class="rainbow-text box">
						<em>Sluurrrp</em> I can imagine that we've all had grape juice. That delicious and tangy fruit that is so refreshing on a warm summer day. I also imagine that you've wondered how that delicious, sweet fruit can turn into a bevrage that make your parents go wild. Let me tell you, it's fermentation. Fermentation is an extremely complex process but let's boil it down. Simply put, when a food/drink sits out in the heat it gets infected with yeast, mold, & bacteria. This is often a bad thing. Mold can make your PB&J look all nasty and disgusting. However, when you put something in a carefully made environment, like wine, it becomes fermented in a good way. It produces alchohol (the crazy stuff we mentioned before) and the grape juice becomes <strong>extremely</strong> tart.

            <h2 class="chapter-title">Why is the Sun considered the ULTIMATE source of energy?</h2>
                
              <p class="rainbow-text box">
Where does energy come from? What would we even call that level of energy. Well the most obvious answer would be <strong>THE ULTIMATE SOURCE OF ENERGY</strong>. We may have big power plants but those are not the ultimate energy sources. It has to be something that is the beginning of all of the energy. What fuels people? Food. What fuels food? Plants. What fuels plants? The Sun. What fuels the Sun? Complex Nuclear fusion but basically nothing. It is the final source of all of our power. It is the foundation of all life forms, <div class="hider">as we know it</div>
